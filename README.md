# OpenRoboticDog

## Required Hardware
The following materials are needed to build the quadruped robot:

| Component | Quantity | Price per unit | Total |
|-----------|----------|----------------|--------|
| PLA Filament | ~500g | - | - |
| STS3215 Servo Motor | 12 | $15 | $180 |
| Motor Control Board | 2 | $11 | $22 |
| USB-C Cable | 2 | $7 | $14 |
| Power Supply | 2 | $10 | $20 |
| M3 Screws | 80 | - | $5 |

**Total Cost:** ~$241 (excluding PLA filament cost)

> **Note:** Most of these components are the same as those used in the [LeRobot project](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100?tab=readme-ov-file) by Hugging Face.

## Description
This project aims to create an affordable, autonomous quadruped robot that anyone can build at home. The goal is to develop a robot capable of performing basic autonomous movements like walking, turning, and basic navigation while keeping the total cost under $250 (excluding 3D printing material).

Key features of this project:
- **Affordable**: Total cost under $250 for all electronic components
- **Home-built**: All parts can be 3D printed at home or through a printing service
- **Autonomous**: Capable of performing basic movements without remote control
- **Open-source**: Complete documentation and code will be available for everyone
- **Educational**: Great project for learning robotics, programming, and 3D printing

The robot will be able to perform various autonomous movements such as:
- Walking forward and backward
- Turning left and right
- Basic obstacle avoidance
- Standing up and lying down
- Maintaining balance

This project is designed to be accessible to hobbyists, students, and robotics enthusiasts who want to learn about quadruped robotics without breaking the bank.

## Features
- Quadruped robot control
- Open-source hardware and software
- Modular design
- Easy to build and customize

## Getting Started
Instructions for setting up and using the project will be added soon.
