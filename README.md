# OpenRoboticDog

## Required Hardware
The following materials are needed to build the quadruped robot:

| Component | Quantity | Price per unit | Total |
|-----------|----------|----------------|--------|
| PLA Filament | ~500g | - | - |
| STS3215 Servo Motor | 12 | $15 | $180 |
| Motor Control Board | 2 | $11 | $22 |
| USB-C Cable | 2 | $7 | $14 |
| Power Supply | 2 | $10 | $20 |
| M3 Screws | 80 | - | $5 |

**Total Cost:** ~$241 (excluding PLA filament cost)

> **Note:** Most of these components are the same as those used in the [LeRobot project](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100?tab=readme-ov-file) by Hugging Face.
